Moreover, it's important to understand the difference between a Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 filing. A Chapter 7 will absolve all your debts entirely while a Chapter 13 filing will require a partial payback of the debts forgiven. If you don't actually qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and wish to proceed with the filing you will have to go the Chapter 13 route (which is usually not the best option). Chapter 13 bankruptcy is very similar to a traditional debt settlement option in that it will restructure your debt obligations to allow for a partial payback of debt owed. So many individuals looking for a feasible debt repayment plan, Chapter 13 tends to be least advised since you will still have many of the negatives associated with doing a bankruptcy with the positives of eliminating your debt scot-free. Either way, you will be put on a strict budget and still be required to pay back a portion of what you owe.","_key":"aca6a22307954","_type":"span"}],"_type":"block"},{"_type":"image","_key":"9f4978854068","asset":{"_ref":"image-094bf76d51d07b5a27041013aa9d34262dacfd9c-1809x2720-webp","_type":"reference"}},{"_type":"block","style":"h2","_key":"575e4392996d","markDefs":[],"children":[{"_key":"6a1167af85870","_type":"span","marks":["strong"],"text":"Debt Consolidation"}]},{"_type":"block","style":"normal","_key":"f2bb621e1c94","markDefs":[{"_type":"link","href":"https://www.thedebtreliefcompany.com/debt-management","_key":"3d0a1c3a836c"},{"href":"https://www.thedebtreliefcompany.com/debt-consolidation","_key":"a3cb49536dae","_type":"link"}],"children":[{"_key":"7ae383b3769d0","_type":"span","marks":[],"text":"There are a multitude of debt consolidation options in the financial services industry today that can help with credit card debt.

Since customers that enroll in a debt relief program are not utilizing a loan to pay back their credit card debt they do not pay any interest in the program. Debt relief programs utilize an FDIC insured saving accounts to accrue funds that are disbursed to creditors throughout the course of the 2-4 year program. Although, these options tend to have some negative impact to your credit worthiness in the short term they are not permanent like a bankruptcy would be and they still allow you save nearly just as much money.
